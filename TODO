9. ### Setting up CD/CI pipeline for this project using https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/
    Make this a 


13. ### Get accuracy scores for the things!!!

14. ### Allow for a k-fold validation.
    Add this as a pipeline object.



17. ### Fix major UI/UX bug where library search is in all different places.
    - WHY: This is happening because we are just hiding the blocks that do not fit the requirement.
    - HOW FIX: after a certian num of character, just hide the whole libary, and append / render these into a smaller horizontally scaling grid / box, rather than a grid.
18. ### Add way to export user generated charts. 
    Maybe build this into the chart view. 
19. ### Remove Base models(non-runnable) from block library
    There are several abstract models included in the library. 


26. ### splash screen example datasets. 

27. ### popover modifications
    - Make some of the controls not fill in the blanks.
    - make some of them into switches or sliders. 
    - 

27. ### Consider having the X-axis and Y-axis input variables located on the X and Y of the graph 

28. ### Add a predict tab to the graph section 

29. ### finish adding the save and save as
    - Add unit testing
    - add a filechooser dialog to save the file.

    - on loading we experience the following issues
        - pluses to add stuff not there

        - Currently, The Y-axis gets an extra holder on start, which is bad. 
            - add an if statment to check this ...

30. ### Make pipeline box scrollable!

31. ### maybe for accuracy for classifiers just make a bar chart with accuracy
    - EX: Green bar for how many right.
    - EX: Red for how many wrong?
