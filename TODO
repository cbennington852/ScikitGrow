37. ### Adding K-fold validation.
    - **Considerations** 
        - This could be added a a pre-processing block, something that the user could drag and drop in.
        - This could also be added as another section to pipeline as drag and drop? 
        (perhaps a validation section?)
        - will this make the software too complicated?
            - likely not?
        - We will also need a "special" model block to tell the model to not do cross validation.
        This would likely be several work hours of work. 
    - **Extra Notes**
        - We should use multi-threading for the k-fold and other validation. There is built in 
        functions to do this. Example `scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)`

17. ### Fix major UI/UX bug where library search is in all different places.
    - WHY: This is happening because we are just hiding the blocks that do not fit the requirement.
    - HOW FIX: after a certian num of character, just hide the whole libary, and append / render these into a smaller horizontally scaling grid / box, rather than a grid.

26. ### splash screen example datasets. 
    - On splash screen transition to a new "page" and then have said page have a back button,
    and on that page have a list of example datasets from seaborne.

27. ### popover modifications
    - Make some of the controls not fill in the blanks.
    - make some of them into switches or sliders. 


28. ### Add a predict tab to the graph section 


35. ### Create a way to export the model? 
    Brainstorming.
        - Export as a "pickle"? https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html
        - Maybe also export as a python script? 
        - ^^^ This could allow for the user to perform predictions? 
        - We could also export a "script" to use said model
        - We could also have a way to "export as software"
            - where a small GUI is made to predict values using the model that the user created!

    Draft 1: 
        We embed the sklearn model in the python file as a "pickle", and then 
        allow the user to load said model and do prediction.
    

36. ### check out a python "compiler" to bytecode ... https://nuitka.net/
    - good for packaging? 

37. ### 1_n_regression, on a large dataset, make the dots transparent?
    - Makes chart more readable?

38. ### add some way to do cross validation and other things.
    - nessicary.
    - Oh also, maybe try to make multi-threaded 


40. ### Have it plot blank scatter plots n'stuff.

42. ### look into how to package this
