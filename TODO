9. ### Setting up CD/CI pipeline for this project using https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/
    - Also GIO has tools for this thing

14. ### Allow for a k-fold validation.
    Add this as a pipeline object.


17. ### Fix major UI/UX bug where library search is in all different places.
    - WHY: This is happening because we are just hiding the blocks that do not fit the requirement.
    - HOW FIX: after a certian num of character, just hide the whole libary, and append / render these into a smaller horizontally scaling grid / box, rather than a grid.

26. ### splash screen example datasets. 

27. ### popover modifications
    - Make some of the controls not fill in the blanks.
    - make some of them into switches or sliders. 


28. ### Add a predict tab to the graph section 


35. ### Create a way to export the model? 
    Brainstorming.
        - Export as a "pickle"? https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html
        - Maybe also export as a python script? 
        - ^^^ This could allow for the user to perform predictions? 
        - We could also export a "script" to use said model
        - We could also have a way to "export as software"
            - where a small GUI is made to predict values using the model that the user created!

    Draft 1: 
        We embed the sklearn model in the python file as a "pickle", and then 
        allow the user to load said model and do prediction.
    

36. ### check out a python "compiler" to bytecode ... https://nuitka.net/
    - good for packaging? 

37. ### put model predictions on different thread than main GUI
