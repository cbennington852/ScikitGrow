9. ### Setting up CD/CI pipeline for this project using https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/
    Make this a 

11. ### General UI/UX improvements

13. ### Get accuracy scores for the things!!!

14. ### Allow for a k-fold validation.
    Add this as a pipeline object.



17. ### Fix major UI/UX bug where library search is in all different places.
    - WHY: This is happening because we are just hiding the blocks that do not fit the requirement.
    - HOW FIX: after a certian num of character, just hide the whole libary, and append / render these into a smaller horizontally scaling grid / box, rather than a grid.
18. ### Add way to export user generated charts. 
    Maybe build this into the chart view. 
19. ### Remove Base models(non-runnable) from block library
    There are several abstract models included in the library. 
20. ### Add way to "save" our models

21. ### Add a splash screen
    - 1. ability to "download examples"
    - 2. ability to save models ? maybe later?
        - use the model "pickle" to save the entire GUI to a file
            - sadly can't save entire gui to file, not possible, we'll have to think of a workaround ... 
                - we'll have to build in some way to .. save the pandas dataframe.
                - also save the current model ... and re-serialize the current model.
                    TO SAVE:
                        - *models + blocks* ... using ListDroppableHolder(), which should have a text based serialize and re-seralize.
                        - *pandas df*
                        - no need to save chart, we can just have it run if works on startup. 
                            - save as a json containing ..
                                ... dataframe
                                ... model + software state
                                ... ListDroppableHolder could have some way to "re-serialise", by naming each list. 
    - 3. ability to open the saved models. 
    - 4. 

24. ### graph theme selection
