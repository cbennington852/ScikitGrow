37. ### Adding K-fold validation.
    - **Considerations** 
        - This could be added a a pre-processing block, something that the user could drag and drop in.
        - This could also be added as another section to pipeline as drag and drop? 
        (perhaps a validation section?)
        - will this make the software too complicated?
            - likely not?
        - We will also need a "special" model block to tell the model to not do cross validation.
        This would likely be several work hours of work. 
    - **Extra Notes**
        - We should use multi-threading for the k-fold and other validation. There is built in 
        functions to do this. Example `scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)`



27. ### popover modifications
    - Make some of the controls not fill in the blanks.
    - make some of them into switches or sliders. 


36. ### check out a python "compiler" to bytecode ... https://nuitka.net/
    - good for packaging? 

37. ### 1_n_regression, on a large dataset, make the dots transparent?
    - Makes chart more readable?

41. ### make it plot 1d classifiers with the k_fold validation


42. ### look into how to package this 
    https://pygobject.gnome.org/devguide/packagingguide.html
    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller --noconfirm --noconsole main.py


## Publication :: Brainstorming
I should probably do a confrence rather than a journal. A journal would be a very long 
and very winded 15-20 pages.

Whereas a conference is a brisker 5 pages.
- Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE)
    https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ujse21
    REQUIRES empirical testing to be done!
    Fees : ~0$ 
    Acceptance rate : 20%

- Educational Technology Research & Development (ETR&D)
    https://link.springer.com/journal/11423
    Focuses on R&D in equational development
    Fees : ~3,000$ 
    Acceptance rate : 20%

- Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)
    https://joss.theoj.org/
    Seeing some very similar projects on here
    Fees : 0$
    Acceptance rate : 60%
    Only accepts my engine, probably not the
    whole software. 
    Relevance: Your Python library for Scikit-learn is a perfect fit. The drag-and-drop tool, if framed as a tool for researchers or advanced students to visually prototype models, might also be accepted under the "research software" definition.

- interactive learning environments
    Fees : ~3,000$


    
### 47. Test performance for diffrnet renders, maybe switch to NGL or vulcan. 
     - Check the render for windows, and maybe switch to NGL, GL, or Vulcan (anything but cairo)

### 48. Organize the folder structure + move the .svg's into something that compiles are a resource.

### 49. Improve the example datasets splash screen, it currently looks funny

### 50. Predict Tab + Adding a sort of "export as python script."
    - Ways to save and export the scikitlearn model.
    - Brainstorming.
        - Export as a "pickle"? https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html
        - Maybe also export as a python script? 
        - ^^^ This could allow for the user to perform predictions? 
        - We could also export a "script" to use said model
        - We could also have a way to "export as software"
            - where a small GUI is made to predict values using the model that the user created!

    Draft 1: 
        We embed the sklearn model in the python file as a "pickle", and then 
        allow the user to load said model and do prediction.
