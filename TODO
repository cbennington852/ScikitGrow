9. ### Setting up CD/CI pipeline for this project using https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/
    - Also GIO has tools for this thing

14. ### Allow for a k-fold validation.
    Add this as a pipeline object.


17. ### Fix major UI/UX bug where library search is in all different places.
    - WHY: This is happening because we are just hiding the blocks that do not fit the requirement.
    - HOW FIX: after a certian num of character, just hide the whole libary, and append / render these into a smaller horizontally scaling grid / box, rather than a grid.
 
19. ### Remove Base models(non-runnable) from block library
    There are several abstract models included in the library. 

26. ### splash screen example datasets. 

27. ### popover modifications
    - Make some of the controls not fill in the blanks.
    - make some of them into switches or sliders. 
    - 

27. ### Consider having the X-axis and Y-axis input variables located on the X and Y of the graph 

28. ### Add a predict tab to the graph section 


30. ### Make pipeline box scrollable!

32. ### Make the accuracy exportable

33. ### Make plotting exportable.
