## Publication :: Brainstorming
I should probably do a confrence rather than a journal. A journal would be a very long 
and very winded 15-20 pages.

Whereas a conference is a brisker 5 pages.

    Only accepts my engine, probably not the
    whole software. 
    Relevance: Your Python library for Scikit-learn is a perfect fit. The drag-and-drop tool, if framed as a tool for researchers or advanced students to visually prototype models, might also be accepted under the "research software" definition.
