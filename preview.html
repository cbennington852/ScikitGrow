<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Data science is often taught at the upper undergraduate levels, with
programming often cited as a prerequisite for learning data science.
DataScratch is software intended to teach novices the core concepts of
data science, without the prerequisite of knowing how to program.
DataScratch achieves this via an intuitive drag and drop interface
modeled after scratch.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-need">Statement of need</h1>
<p>The current educational landscape presents a significant hurdle for
novices seeking to engage with data science. While foundational
mathematical concepts like algebra and basic statistics are often
introduced in high school, students often do not study data science and
AI until middle-late undergraduate.</p>
<p>Many educators cite that programming is a barrier to entry to data
science <span class="citation"
data-cites="bart2016implementing thayer2020practical brunner2016teaching">(Bart
et al. 2016; Thayer 2020; Brunner and Kim 2016)</span>. This is because
many tools and libraries for data science are called programmatically.
The cognitive load associated with learning both programming syntax and
complex statistical concepts simultaneously is often deemed detrimental
to meaningful learning.</p>
<p>This lack of accessible entry points limits the potential for
widespread data science literacy. As AI increasingly permeates various
aspects of modern life understanding its underlying principles becomes
essential. Data science literacy empowers individuals to critically
evaluate these systems, fostering informed decision-making and promoting
responsible technological development<span class="citation"
data-cites="provost2013data jain2021smart">(Provost and Fawcett 2013;
Jain 2021)</span>. Moreover, a basic grasp of AI models can demystify
complex technologies, enabling students to navigate a world shaped by
intelligent systems with greater confidence and agency.<span
class="citation" data-cites="hsu2025effects">(Hsu and Chen
2025)</span></p>
<p>Therefore, there’s an urgent need for tools that prioritize
accessibility and intuitive learning. A low barrier to entry is
paramount; users should be able to explore core data science concepts
without needing prior programming experience. This necessitates a
paradigm shift away from code-centric approaches towards user-friendly
interfaces that abstract the complexities of programming while
preserving the fundamental principles of data analysis.</p>
<p>DataScratch directly addresses this need by offering a visual,
drag-and-drop environment for building and experimenting with AI models.
By removing the immediate requirement to write code, DataScratch
provides novice users with an accessible gateway to exploring core
concepts in data science and AI.</p>
<h1 id="state-of-the-field">State of the field</h1>
<p>There are several no-code, low code platforms available on the
internet. However these are often designed with power users in mind, and
are often expensive, making them frustrating to novices. Many of these
softwares are geared toward commercial data science use, with a focus on
integration with common business tools.</p>

<p>Scratch<span class="citation"
data-cites="resnick2009scratch">(Resnick et al. 2009)</span>, a visual
programming language designed for children, offers a compelling model
for accessible computational learning. Its intuitive drag-and-drop
interface allows beginners to grasp fundamental programming concepts
without needing to decipher complex syntax. Scratch’s interface has been
proven to be effective at teaching novices programming concepts, and
assist learners when the transition to “real” programming<span
class="citation" data-cites="armoni2015scratch">(Armoni,
Meerbaum-Salant, and Ben-Ari 2015)</span>. <img

title="Image showing equivalent python and scratch code."
alt="blocks v python" /></p>
<p>This project was heavily inspired by scratch. The design of the
column blocks is similar to the scratch stack blocks. Additionally the
design of the validators is modeled after the scratch boolean logic
blocks.</p>
<h1 id="software-design">Software design</h1>
<p>The language for this software is python, this is because python
possesses several libraries, such as pandas<span class="citation"
data-cites="reback2020pandas">(team 2020)</span>, matplotlib<span
class="citation" data-cites="Hunter:2007">(Hunter 2007)</span>, and
scikit-learn[<span class="citation" data-cites="scikit-learn">Pedregosa
et al. (2011)</span>;sklearn_api], which are standard tools for data
science and AI modeling. Another reason would be portability. If a user
desires features that are beyond the scope of DataScratch, the software
is built in a way the models and utilizes underlying data science
libraries, to make the transition from using DataScratch to programming
in python easier.</p>
<p>The GUI software was originally written using a python library called
PyGtk<span class="citation" data-cites="pygobject2025">(GNOME Project
2026)</span>, however after several months of development this library
was dropped, due to the PyGtk library having a non-functional pip
installation, and graphical issues when run on windows. Additionally,
electron was considered, with the benefit being easier styling, however
it did not posses seamless python support. The project later switched to
PyQt, which featured cross platform support, and allowed for
installation via pip by default.</p>
<p>The drag and drop interface was designed to be easy to use, with the
layout and design imitating underlying python libraries. This ensures
that users have an low floor to learning, while also paving the way for
them to transition to writing code later.<br />
<img src="paper_images/Python_v_datascratch.png"
title="Image showing the complexity of coding versus the new drag and drop interface."
alt="blocks v python" /></p>
<p>The interface also enables the user to assemble and train multiple
models at once, allowing for quick model comparison. This enables common
user desires within data science, where data scientists often compare
and contrast models. Another purpose of this feature is to allow users
to learn the differences between certain models. <img
src="paper_images/Example_model_comparison.svg"
title="Image showing model comparison for the software."
alt="model comparison" /></p>
<p>Additionally, Datascratch comes pre-loaded with several example
datasets, which have been crafted to be usable to a wide range of users,
allowing novices to get learning right away, without having to procure a
dataset first.</p>
<p>The interface also allows the user to input manual predictions,
allowing for novices to interact with their newly created AI models.
This tab enables the user to export their saved models as software,
which is where a user can save their trained model, and access it later.
The software also enables the exporting as pickle, which fulfills the
needs of potential power users. <img

<h1 id="ai-usage-disclosure">AI usage disclosure</h1>
<p>The dataframe_viewer class was heavily written by AI. This is a small
subclass which renders a pandas dataframe as a PyQt table. Google was
used to search for API documentation. The built in AI overview on google
cannot be deactivated, and thus the AI overview was unintentionally used
upon each google search. Oftentimes, the AI overview provided false
information, and was later ignored due to a lack of verifiability.</p>
<p>Generative AI was later used during the proofreading stage of writing
the paper, with it helping catch several clarity and grammatical errors.
These AI suggestions were then verified with human experts.</p>
