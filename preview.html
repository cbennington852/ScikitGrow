<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Data science is a current and evolving field. Currently, this field
is historicity a extremely coding heavy field. DataScratch is a novel
approach to perform data science tasks, such as model training, and
validation, through drag and drop interface without requiring heavy
coding knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-need">Statement of need</h1>
<p>The current educational landscape presents a significant hurdle for
novices seeking to engage with data science. While foundational
mathematical concepts like algebra and basic statistics are often
introduced in high school, students often do not study data science and
AI until middle-late undergraduate.</p>
<p>Many educators cite that programming is a barrier to entry to data
science <span class="citation"
data-cites="bart2016implementing thayer2020practical brunner2016teaching">(Bart
et al. 2016; Thayer 2020; Brunner and Kim 2016)</span>. This is because
many tools and libraries for data science are called programmatically.
The cognitive load associated with learning both programming syntax and
complex statistical concepts simultaneously is often deemed detrimental
to meaningful learning.</p>
<p>This lack of accessible entry points limits the potential for
widespread data science literacy. As AI increasingly permeates various
aspects of modern life understanding its underlying principles becomes
essential. Data science literacy empowers individuals to critically
evaluate these systems, fostering informed decision-making and promoting
responsible technological development<span class="citation"
data-cites="provost2013data jain2021smart">(Provost and Fawcett 2013;
Jain 2021)</span>. Moreover, a basic grasp of AI models can demystify
complex technologies, enabling students to navigate a world shaped by
intelligent systems with greater confidence and agency.<span
class="citation" data-cites="hsu2025effects">(Hsu and Chen
2025)</span></p>
<p>Therefore, there’s an urgent need for tools that prioritize
accessibility and intuitive learning. A low barrier to entry is
paramount; users should be able to explore core data science concepts
without needing prior programming experience. This necessitates a
paradigm shift away from code-centric approaches towards user-friendly
interfaces that abstract the complexities of programming while
preserving the fundamental principles of data analysis.</p>
<p>DataScratch directly addresses this need by offering a visual,
drag-and-drop environment for building and experimenting with AI models.
By removing the immediate requirement to write code, DataScratch
provides novice users with an accessible gateway to exploring core
concepts in data science and AI.</p>
<h1 id="state-of-the-field">State of the field</h1>
<p>There are several no-code, low code platforms available on the
internet. However these are often designed with power users in mind, and
are often expensive, making them frustrating to novices. Many of these
softwares are geared twoard commercial data science use, with a focus on
integration with common business tools.</p>

<p>Scratch, a visual programming language designed for children, offers
a compelling model for accessible computational learning. Its intuitive
drag-and-drop interface allows beginners to grasp fundamental
programming concepts without needing to decipher complex syntax.
DataScratch seeks to replicate this accessibility within the realm of
data science.</p>
<h1 id="software-design">Software design</h1>
<p>The language for this software is python, this is because python
possesses several libraries, such as pandas[CITATION],
matplotlib[CITATION], and scikit-learn[CITATION], which are standard
tools for data science and AI modeling. Another reason would be
portability. If a user desires features that are beyond the scope of
DataScratch, the software is built in a way the models and utilizes
underlying data science libraries, to make the transition from using
DataScratch to programming in python easier.</p>
<p>The GUI software was originally written using a python library called
PyGtk[CITATION], however after several months of development this
library was dropped, due to the PyGtk library having a non-functional
pip installation, and graphical issues when run on windows.
Additionally, electron was considered, with the benifit being easier
styling, however it did not posses seamless python support. The project
later switched to PyQt, which featured cross platform support, and
allowed for installation via pip by default.</p>
<p>The drag and drop components are modeled closely after
scratch[CITATION], a library which has been shown to be very intuitive
and easy to use[CITATION]. This choice was intended to make the software
easier to use for people who aren’t heavy coders. The shape of each
draggable block corresponds to a shape on the pipeline to give the user
visual signifiers telling them where things should go.<br />

title="Image showing the complexity of coding versus the new drag and drop interface."
alt="blocks v python" /> The interface also enables the user to assemble
and train multiple models at once, allowing for quick model comparison.
This enables common user desires within data science, where data
scientists often compare and contrast models. <img

<p>Additionally, Datascratch comes pre-loaded with several example
datasets, which have been crafted to be usable to a wide range of users,
allowing novices to get learning right away, without having to procure a
dataset first. <img src="paper_images/diamonds_descriptive.png"

<h1 id="ai-usage-disclosure">AI usage disclosure</h1>
<p>The dataframe_viewer class was heavily written by AI. This is a small
subclass which renders a pandas dataframe as a PyQt table. Google was
used to search for API documentation. The built in AI overview on google
cannot be deactivated, and thus the AI overview was unintentionally used
upon each google search. Oftentimes, the AI overview provided false
information, and was later ignored due to a lack of verifiability.</p>
<p>Generative AI was later used during the proofreading stage of writing
the paper, with it helping catch several clarity and grammatical errors.
These AI suggestions were then verified with human experts.</p>
